Introduction to limits, derivatives, and integrals. Rules for differentiation and integration.

### Key Definitions
- **Limit:** The value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value.
- **Derivative:** Represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function, or the slope of the tangent line at a point.
- **Integral:** Represents the accumulation of quantities, often interpreted as the area under the curve of a function.
- **Continuity:** A function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.
- **Differentiability:** A function is differentiable at a point if its derivative exists at that point (implies continuity).

### Key Formulas/Concepts
- Limit Definition (Informal): 
$$
 \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L 
$$
means $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $c$.

- Derivative Definition (Limit Form):
$$
 f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} 
$$

- Power Rule for Differentiation: 
$$
 \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1} 
$$

- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1): If 
$$
 F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt \implies F'(x) = f(x) 
$$

- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 2):
$$
F'(x) = f(x) \implies \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

- Power Rule for Integration: 
$$
 \int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C 
$$
