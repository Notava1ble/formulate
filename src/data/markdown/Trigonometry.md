Study of triangles, circles, angles, and relationships between sides and angles. Key formulas: sine, cosine, tangent.

### Key Definitions
*   **Angle:** Formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint (vertex).
*   **Radian:** A unit of angle measure based on the radius of a circle (d$$ \pi d$$ radians = 180 degrees).
*   **Sine (sin):** In a right triangle, the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.
*   **Cosine (cos):** In a right triangle, the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
*   **Tangent (tan):** In a right triangle, the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
*   **Unit Circle:** A circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin, used to define trigonometric functions for all angles.

### Key Formulas/Concepts

- SOH CAH TOA: 

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} 
$$

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} 
$$

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} 
$$


- Pythagorean Identity:
    
$$
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 
$$

- Tangent Identity: 
$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} 
$$

- Law of Sines: 
$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} 
$$

- Law of Cosines: 
$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C 
$$
